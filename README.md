## One-sentence pitch

A nostalgic top-down pixel-art survival RPG where you build a life in a warm, persistent town, then risk each night outside its lights on tense loot-and-extract expeditions.

Why is the city on lockdown? Why does Gozer only go out alone (or coop)? How did Gozer become a hero? 

## The player fantasy

You are the "town Gozer". Which locally simply means a kind of hero. Everyone knows you in town, you are looked up to and feared. Also frequently asked for favors.

Return home carrying a rare, hard-won find after a frightening run. Use it to make the town safer, stranger, and more alive; then decide how much further to push your luck tomorrow night.

The feeling is deliberately built on contrast:

- **Day / town:** warm, personal, calm, social, and full of visible progress.
- **Night / wilderness:** dark, loud, unpredictable, and increasingly hostile.

## Creative pillars

1. **Nostalgia with a modern hook** — readable pixel art, tactile inventory and crafting, memorable sound effects, and compact places that invite exploration.
2. **A home worth returning to** — the town is not a menu. It visibly changes from resources, choices, and consequences.
3. **Meaningful extraction tension** — each expedition is a choice between leaving safely and risking another room, objective, or rare resource.
4. **Great alone; better together** — solo is a complete first-class experience. Co-op amplifies stories rather than making the game playable.
5. **Short, replayable sessions** — a good run takes roughly 10–20 minutes, with long-term RPG and town progression across many runs.

## Core loop

```text
Prepare in town
  → choose gear, supplies, and a destination
  → enter a dangerous expedition zone
  → explore, fight, loot, and complete objectives
  → decide when to extract
  → return with resources, injuries, discoveries, or problems
  → upgrade town, unlock options, and prepare again
```

## Setting and tone

An isolated town survives at the edge of a wilderness that becomes unnatural after dark... Every direction you "go out" to from the city is different.; the wilderness, outside of town, is an overgrown industrial exclusion zone // a cursed forest // a collapsed underground world. It is full of literal montsers, town people who became part of the wilderness and animals.

The important tonal rule: town life is genuinely comforting and cozy. Outside the city is dark and scary.

## Single-player implementation

- **Solo-scaled encounters:** reduce enemy count and simultaneous threats, but retain dangerous enemy behaviors, sound cues, and decision-making.
- **Risk comes from pressure, not numbers:** limited healing, limited inventory, darkness, distance from extraction, and escalating night danger make a solo run tense.
- **Active extraction:** extraction is a physical destination such as a lift, gate, train platform, or radio beacon. Triggering it may take time or make noise.
- **Recovery instead of pure punishment:** death or retreat should cost the current haul and create an injury/problem, while permanent town upgrades, key discoveries, and story progress remain.
- **Optional helpers later:** earned tools can assist without replacing the player: a scout drone, tracking dog, portable workbench, or an NPC guard at extraction.

## Co-op implementation

Co-op is optional drop-in play using the same places, systems, and rules as solo.

| System | Single-player | Co-op |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Combat | Fewer concurrent threats; enemies remain dangerous | More mixed threats and chances to divide attention |
| Loot | All loot belongs to the player | Trading is available between co-op players. |
| Objectives | One player can complete every objective | Optional tasks reward splitting up or coordinating |
| Downed state | Injury, escape item, or costly retreat | Teammates can revive or carry a downed player |
| Extraction | Player chooses when to leave | Each player can leave with their haul, or the group chooses a shared extraction rule |
| Town | Personal persistent town | Join the host's town; visitors contribute resources and retain personal character progression |


## Shared tension system: contamination

The wilderness contains valuable **cursed / contaminated** items. Bringing them back may unlock powerful upgrades, unusual NPC events, or new areas—but also causes a town-level problem.

- In solo, the player chooses whether the reward is worth managing the consequence.
- In co-op, the same choice becomes a real group discussion.
- The result is visible: sick crops, power failures, strange visitors, altered town defenses, or new story branches.

This is the game's signature rule: **every expedition can change home.** Consequences are real.

## Reference palette

Use references as signals for feeling and structure, not features to copy.

- **Minecraft / Terraria:** discovery, progression through materials, unexpected stories, a world that feels worth poking at.
- **Stardew Valley:** a place that feels like home and develops emotional value.
- **Among Us / Mimesis:** suspense caused by uncertainty and social decisions, without requiring player betrayal.
- **Counter-Strike:** clear weapon identity, precise feedback, recognizable sound, and high-stakes moments.

## Combat direction

Combat should be simple to learn and rich in feedback.

- Top-down, direct aiming.
- Small, distinct weapon roster: for example revolver, shotgun, rifle, improvised melee tool.
- Every weapon needs a readable rhythm, recoil, sound profile, and ideal range.
- Enemies should be identified by behavior as much as appearance.
- Sound is a mechanic you need to look out for: gunshots, broken glass, alarms, and extraction machinery can attract danger.

The ones outside want to get inside. Kill you. You "stayed inside", you are "one of them". You should be outside with them, free and wild (they think).
